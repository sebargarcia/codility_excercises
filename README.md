# Codility excercises (https://app.codility.com/programmers/)

**Just clone the repo, each excercise has its own file.**

don´t forget to do npm install before :sunglasses:

The excercises included are:

- BinaryGap: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer. (score: 100%)
- CyclicRotation: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps. (score: 87%)
- coin game (This is a private exam excercise, not working at all, I have to re implement it) (score: 22%)

WARNING: This is how I resolve the excercises, maybe there are not the best way to resolve it but I want to document my progress. Maybe later I will update them to be more performant or more beatufull xD.
NOTE: All excercises are resolved in typescript (But codility don´t support it yet). I will be updating excercises when I have resolved.

TODO:

-It would be great to add tests with some testing library.
